# Stats_Projects-HW
This repository is a collection of my academic coursework. It includes projects and other R files from my statistics courses at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/). Throughout my time as a statistics major, I completed projects that require advanced statistical modeling, shiny web development, and more. Click on each course folder and navigate to the "projects" directory to find .Rmd files with my R code and finalized technical reports.
